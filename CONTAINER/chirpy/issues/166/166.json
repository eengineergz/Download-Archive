    "Description": "currently if a view is a chirp compressed file like `View.chirp.cshtml` there is no way to tell chirpy to skip one script block.  It would be nice to have such ability.\r\n\r\nWhy I need this, because sometimes I use two script blocks. One is specific to that partial view, second is generated (which contains c# code).",
