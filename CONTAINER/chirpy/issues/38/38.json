We're still working out some of the kinks.\n\nA few quick questions:\n\nWhen you go to Tools > Add-In Manager, is Chirpy checked (both boxes)?\nWhen you open Documents\\Visual Studio 2010\\AddIns\\Zippy.AddIn, what info do you see?\nAre ANY of the extensions working (e.g. .whitespace.js, .chirp.css, .chirp.config, etc.)?\n\nI'm happy to help, so, if you want to troubleshoot further, I'd be happy to do it over e-mail, or via this forum.\n\nThanks!\nEvan\n",
