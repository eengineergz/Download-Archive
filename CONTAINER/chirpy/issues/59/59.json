      "Message": "In the old version i could specify on the filegroup minify=false and on an individual file minify=true, and it would generate my normal all.js file. now if you specify minify anywhere at all you always get a all.min.js\n\nFor example:\n<FileGroup Name=\"all.js\" Minify=\"false\">\n<File Path=\"jquery-1.4.4.min.js\" Minify=\"false\" />\n<File Path=\"normal.js\" Minify=\"true\" />\n<File Path=\"do-some-debugging-here.js\" Minify=\"false\" />\n</FileGroup>\n\nwill output all.min.js file event though i explicitly said the group should not be minified (if i then choose to minify or not an individual file inside the group, that should be my option)\n\n\nThe problem is that i don't want to re-reference all the aspx files to point to *.min.js or *.debug.js each time i want todo some tests, i just want it to point to all.js ..like this when the site is working normally my all.js file contains minified code, but if i need to quickly debug some code, i just toss a version of the all.js file with non minified code on the server to get some traces back (this was working fine in 1.0.5).\n\nWe currently have our site loadbalanced across 5 servers, and sometimes i need do live tests on one of them by tossing a debug version of all.js it, and it sends me window.error info via ajax to a healthmonitoring endpoint ..and well, the line info from windo.error doesn't really work well with minified code :)\n",
