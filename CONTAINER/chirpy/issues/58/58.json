    "Description": "We would love to not have to install the extension on each machine, as it's just one more thing to do. I currently have Chirpy set as a post-build task in our solution, but it still uses the non-local Google Closure service, and we've been getting rate limited.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to tell the console version of Chirpy to use offline google closure compiler?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the console app should have all the functionality of the extension, and that the extension should just forward commands to the console app...",
