    "Description": "Can we have the option so the generated files don't getting attached into the solution?\r\n\r\nI have the followings problems with the generated files included as a part of my solution:\r\n\r\n1. When negating to file by name, (with Resharper: ctrl + shift + T), I have to choose the less file over the generated css files. \r\n2. Each time that I copy-paste less file,  in order to create a new one, I get an error that the css files already created.\r\n3. After each copy-paste less file, in order to create a new one, I need to make my VisualHG to forget about the generated files, in order to don't get them source controlled.\r\n\r\nThanks for a great time saver project!",
