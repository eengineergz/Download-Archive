    "Description": "I'm using @import in my .less file. The chirp.config file includes the parent.less file and updates correctly when I save it, but does not update when I save the child.less file. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice if Chirpy could recursively find the imports and update when those are saved. Alternatively, I would be happy if I could just add the files to watch in the chirp.config file without those being included in the output (eg, add a <Watch Path=\"\" /> element).",
