    "Description": "When using chirpy on projects that are source controlled through TFS, my colleagues and I have noticed that the grouping of files does not work. When i say grouping i refer to in the project list we would like to see one chirp file (.js, .less etc), and see the normal, and minified files underneath that file in the tree structure of the solution explorer.\r\n\r\nWe have this feature working on projects not source controlled, so can only come to the conclusion it is TFS managed projects having this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJoe",
