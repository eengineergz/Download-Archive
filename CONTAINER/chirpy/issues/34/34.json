    "Description": "I have v1.0.0.5 installed in  VS 2010 with the default configuration. I have 1 .chirp.css file and 1 .chirp.less file. Those are working perfectly. The first one is generating a minified .min.css file upon saves. The second file is transforming into a .css file and minifying to a .min.css file upon saves.\r\n\r\nI have a .chirp.config file that mashes the 2 minified files together without further minifying them. Here is the .chirp.config file:\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\r\n<root xmlns=\"urn:ChirpyConfig\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">\r\n\t<FileGroup Name=\"merged.css\">\r\n\t\t<File Path=\"baseline.min.css\" Minify=\"false\" />\r\n\t\t<File Path=\"prototype.min.css\" Minify=\"false\" />\r\n\t</FileGroup>\r\n</root>\r\n\r\nThe merged file was created immediately, as expected. However, now when I make changes to the second file, prototype.chirp.less, and save it, merged.css is not regenerated automatically (prototype.min.css is properly updated). In addition, I can save prototype.chirp.less 2 times in a row to force merged.css to update. In some cases, even saving the less file twice won't initiate the merged.css update (this is rare, but does happen).\r\n\r\nI understand that this is a chained relationship: prototype.chirp.less auto-updates prototype.min.css which should be detected by the .chirp.config file in order to auto-update merged.css. Perhaps, this is the source of the issue. It sounds reasonable since a double save seems to work 99% of the time.\r\n\r\nI've tried setting the Minify attribute to false on the FileGroup instead of the individual File elements without better success.\r\n\r\n\r\nLove this tool, by the way!",

I eventually ran into problems with 1.0.0.3 as well and have had to revert to @haack's T4CSS.tt for my Less sheets.\n\nThis might show ignorance on my part, but I find it odd that the plugin doesn't install any of the DLLs required for compression or parsing of Less. Is this a step I've missed out? Should the installer be installing third party DLLs? I tried dropping the DDLs into the plugins folder to no avail.\n\nRich",
