      "Message": "Hey Andrew,\n\nNot sure what Wayne was getting at with that one.\n\nYou could create two chirp.config files. The first mashes together all of the files; the second points to the first mashed file, and you specify that the created file should be minified.\n\nThen, you can do a good old fashioned #if DEBUG conditional, swapping out the one mashed file for the other.\n\nDoes this solution not work for you? I can see what you've suggested as a nice feature, but I think it might complicate things a wee bit.\n\nCheers,\nEvan\n\n",
