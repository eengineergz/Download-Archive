    "Description": "Hi, Guys, I think Chirpy is great and all that (same as everyone else :-)\r\n\r\nBut this simple bug does not seem to have been fixed for a while now.\r\n\r\nThis is the entry in the MyMash.chirp.config:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <FileGroup Name=\"SomeTests.js\">\r\n        <Folder Path=\"..\\..\\..\\TestProj\\TestFolder\\\" Pattern=\"*.js\" Minify=\"false\" />\r\n    </FileGroup>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis config entry has the effect of putting chirpy into an infinite loop; and from the console one can see SomeTests.js being repeated written to.\r\n\r\nI am using the latest version (2.0.0.4 released on 04-Jan-2012).\r\n\r\nIs there a solution to this problem? Needless to say this will be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
