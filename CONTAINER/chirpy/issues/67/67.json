I have a .NET 4 website that I am trying Chirpy on.  \n\nI've tried creating a test.yui.js and a test.chirpy.js file and neither one of them did anything.  No min files were created and no codebehind shows up.  All of our code is in TFS if that helps.  ",

I downloaded v2 from the front page of Codeplex and installed it.  Chirpy appears to be working just fine on my .NET 4 website.  It does add the .min files and they appear as \"code-behind\" files in the UI.  Thanks!",
