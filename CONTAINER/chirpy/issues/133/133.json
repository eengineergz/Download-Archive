HAve I missed anything important?\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nkind regards,\r\n\r\nVaralonga",

      "Message": "Hi!\n\n\nSorry for the pressure, but I really need to know if it's possible to compress JS files (and maybe CSS files) to a single line. We're using many JS and CSS files, many of them with a considerable amount of lines, and this little detail can make the difference in the final size of the compressed file.\nThanks in advance and, once again, congrats for the awesome app!\n\nkind regards,\n\nVitor",
