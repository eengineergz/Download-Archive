    "Description": "Right now, the mashed files that Chirpy generates are created as \"codebehinds\" under the corresponding \".chirp.config\" file. I'm interested to know whether we should allow users to output the file anywhere, in any folder. Thoughts? I like that Chirpy protects against overwriting files, but I do see the benefit of NOT placing the config file in a public content folder.",
