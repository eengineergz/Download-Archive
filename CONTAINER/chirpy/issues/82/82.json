    "Description": "Since installing the Chirpy add-in (although the add-in itself works great) every time I open my solution now, my Web Application (in which a chirpy config file is present) gets checked out from TFS. I assume this would also be the case in other source control systems, but no changes are made to the project, it simply gets checked out. Its not a big deal but a minor headache none-the-less.",
