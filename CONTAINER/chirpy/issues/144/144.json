    "Description": "I was using YUI minifier, and everything was working fine. All files being minified automatically got checked out from TFS both with source file.\r\n\r\nBut I realized, that offline Google Closure compiler performs better, I saved almost 100KB in result size. But, unfortunately - when I use it, it some why doesn't check out minified files.",
