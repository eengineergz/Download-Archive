Try again later\"\r\n\r\nthis is due to the limitation of google api.\r\nIt happened to me a couple of times, nothing so frustrating, but it would be nice if you could implement the minify feature using the offline version of closure...\r\n\r\nhttp://code.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/gettingstarted_app.html",
