    "Description": "So up until now I haven't been using Chirpy.\r\n\r\nI like it and I want to use it.  It's easy to install.\r\n\r\nBut getting my solution working after the install is harder than it needs to be.\r\n\r\nI wish I could tell Chirpy to process A.*.css and produce A.css.  If I could do that, then I wouldn't have to update any of my code that referenced the .css files, as the name wouldn't have changed, but I'd still be getting 100% Chirpiness.",

This is not useful when that filename already contains .min.  Or if I want to periodically change the Minify value, then the output filename changes.",
