    "Description": "Sometimes when I have errors in my .less code and then go back and fix them, the errors aren't cleared from the Visual Studio Error List. \r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure, but it seems the problem tends to happen when there is an error in a file that is included from another .less file (I have a .less file that has just common mixins that I @import into the .less files that are compiled by chirpy).\r\n\r\nI am using Visual Studio 2010 and the latest version of Chirpy.
