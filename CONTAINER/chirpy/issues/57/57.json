    "Description": "Hi all!\r\n\r\nI just wanted to report an issue I found today after struggling for a bit to find what was wrong. My mashed JS file was not getting updated when changes were made to any of the files in the .chirp.config file. In addition, I nuked the generated files attached to the .config file and re-saved, made changes and saved, etc. with nothing being generated. I even recreated the config file to no avail. I checked the Output window and only saw \"ConfigEngine -- [path to my .chrip.config file]\".\r\n\r\nAfter staring at the config file for another 5 minutes without blinking, it hit me! I deleted one of the .js files that was in a FileGroup yesterday. So, Chirpy wasn't finding the file. The \"bug\" isn't that it didn't regenerate, it's that it didn't report what the problem was. ;-)\r\n\r\nThanks for such a great product!",
