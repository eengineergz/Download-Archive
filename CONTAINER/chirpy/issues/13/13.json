    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\n would it be possible to use the file name format {name}.chirp.less.css instead of {name}.chirp.less or support both so that Visual Studio gives you some degree of CSS syntax highlighting? I know it'll highlight mixins etc as errors but wouldn't it be better to have some form of syntax highlighting instead of none?",
