Chirpy is chippy. Use [Google Closure Tools](http://code.google.com/closure/), [YUI Compressor for .Net](http://yuicompressor.codeplex.com/), [Ajax Minifier](http://www.asp.net/ajaxlibrary/AjaxMinDocumentation.ashx), or [Uglify.js](https://github.com/mishoo/cl-uglify-js) to minify and mash all of your precious assets.  It's easy, it's flexible, and it's automatic.

Chirpy also flirts with T4. Auto-run your T4 templates. Smart-run your T4MVC template. Make your friends and family members uber-jealous.
