Chirpy is chippy. Use [url:Google Closure Tools|http://code.google.com/closure/], [url:YUI Compressor for .Net|http://yuicompressor.codeplex.com/], [url:Ajax Minifier|http://www.asp.net/ajaxlibrary/AjaxMinDocumentation.ashx], or [url:Uglify.js|https://github.com/mishoo/cl-uglify-js] to minify and mash all of your precious assets.  It's easy, it's flexible, and it's automatic.

Chirpy also flirts with T4. Auto-run your T4 templates. Smart-run your T4MVC template. Make your friends and family members uber-jealous.

*NEW* Chirpy now supports  [url:CoffeeScript|http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/] ,  [url:Sass|http://sass-lang.com/]!
