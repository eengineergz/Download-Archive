    "Html": "\r\n<p>I haven't tried other combinations, but Chirpy seems to have an issue when combining multiple inline functions / libraries. &nbsp;I'm not sure who is at fault, but when you combine to files that look like (function(){...})(); &nbsp;The ending ';' is removed\r\n from both files. &nbsp;This is an error when they are combined. &nbsp;It combines like... (function(){...})()(function(){...}(), but it should have had the ';' between the two files. &nbsp;I sure hope this makes sense. &nbsp;The new MS code when you pass it\r\n an XML file to combine files works correctly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for the great tool. &nbsp;I hope this is something that can be resolved so that I can continue using it with our project.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ricky</p>\r\n",

The threshold value by default should be set to a max value and not something so little as 50. &nbsp;The max value from ajaxmin is Int32-1000. &nbsp;In my testing...
