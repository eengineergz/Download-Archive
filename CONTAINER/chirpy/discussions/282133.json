It doesn't build out of the box and there are no build instructions.</p>\r\n<p>First off, ilmerge and 7za need to be installed and in the PATH before the build will succeed. No problem. Done.</p>\r\n<p>Now I can build, but i get several warnings about references.&nbsp;Nevertheless, it succeeds so I copy the dll into the Addin folder. The addin gets picked up by VS and is marked as enabled. But when I save any file which Chirpy should be watching I get\r\n nothing. The only output from Chirpy is &quot;Ready&quot; when VS starts.</p>\r\n<p>I'm using a fairly fresh install of 64bit Windows 7 and VS 2010.</p>\r\n",
