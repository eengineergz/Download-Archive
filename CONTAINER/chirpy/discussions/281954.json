If it has changed (or it doesn't find a newer version) it could then fall back to the built in version.</p>\r\n<p>Just from a conceptual point of view, Chirpy is ideal for this type of dynamic composition.</p>\r\n<p>What are your thoughts?</p>\r\n",

You can even have one engine rely on another simply by [Import]ing the IEngineResolver.</p>\r\n<p>All you need to do to create an external engine is reference ChirpyInterface, implement IChirpyEngine, decorate your class with the [Export] attribute and the [ChirpyEngineMetadata(...)] attribute passing in the name of the engine, a category and a default file extension. (the attributes of the metadata object are provided mainly for example)</p>\r\n<p>With this setup you can extend existing engines and even add new engines without having to recompile Chirpy.</p>\r\n<p>You will obviously want to expand the IChirpyEngine interface to allow all the behviour you need.&nbsp;You could even expose a method for each engine to supply its own configuration options and use that to build dynamic config pages? (I don't know, I've not done any VS plugin development before.)</p>\r\n<p>Cheers</p>",
