If i put one on top of a .chirp.less file it doesn't seem to included that in the parsing.  the file is located in the same folder as the .chirp.less file.  I have tried using a standard .less extension on the file to import as well as a .chirp.less (but i don't need this to be precessed into css so using a standard .less extension would be great.",

Does that make sense? I've tested @import *.less, and the imports do get appropriately translated into standard css.\r\n\r\nSorry for the delay on this. If you're still experiencing issues, let me know. I'll be releasing a cleaner version of the Add-In today. So, if all else fails... :)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nEvan\r\n\r\n",
