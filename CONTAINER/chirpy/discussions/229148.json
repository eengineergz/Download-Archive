I called the exe as following</p>\r\n<p>chirpy.exe &quot;pathToProject&quot; and the project I was testing it on had one foo.yui.js and one bar.chirp.less file</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(1) Following line threw an NullReferenceException</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><em><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">extensions = extensions == null ? Settings.AllExtensions : extensions.Union(Settings.AllExtensions).ToArray();</span></em></p>\r\n<p>In the Utilities.GetBaseFileName method. The reason for it is that Settings.AllExtensions is null. However, if I commented</p>\r\n<p>out the line then it was able to build a foo.min.js file as expected!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(2) When it got to the bar.chirp.less file there was another problem. The TransformToCss method in the LessEngine.cs file</p>\r\n<p>throw another NullReferenceException, this time for the following line</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><em>TaskList.Instance.Add(projectItem.ContainingProject, Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.TaskErrorCategory.Error, fullFileName, line, column, description);</em></span></p>\r\n<p>The reason being that TaskList.Instance is null.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All in all it doesnt appear that Chirpy is quite ready for a console runner since there seem to be a couple of dependencies for the IDE</p>\r\n<p>still.&nbsp;However, I'm not quite sure why either engines work when they are invoked from inside of Visual Studio by the add-in, even though that I can see</p>\r\n<p>in the output window that they have executed. I really hope you can help me resolve this since the capabilities it adds to a web developer is</p>\r\n<p>awesome.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks you, looking forward to resolving this issue soon</p>",
