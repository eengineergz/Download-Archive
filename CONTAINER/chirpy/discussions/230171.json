The command llive version works perfectly but any attempt to install the add-in throws an unknown error on load.</p>\r\n<p>Just like Vincent I am using VS 2010 on Win 7 x64.</p>\r\n<p>I have tried building from source with the latest set (<span style=\"font-weight:bold\">545c2664560a</span>) and it's still the same problem. Also tried the packaged releases <span>v1.0.0.5.3</span>, v1.0.0.5.2, and a couple of earlier ones too just for good measure but so far no success.</p>\r\n<p>In fact I tried debugging the add-in but the error seems to occur before I can even get to the point of debugging. I started to wonder if I was missing some sort of dependency but I have the Visual Studio SDK, Java runtime and SDK, and everything else I could find that looks like it might even be a remote dependency. I am starting to think it's related to the way WOW64 has a seperate set of registry keys and if nobody has a solution soon I will go digging in that direction because this is exactly the tool I want my team to use - assuming we can make it work of course.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Philippe</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
