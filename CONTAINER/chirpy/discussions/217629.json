Was considering integrating minification combination of js and css into MSBuild until I came across this and this does something very similar.</p>\r\n<p>Wonder though if it would be possible to integrate in the conversion of images in css into a base64 string, resulting in less http requests. I believe only IE8+ supports such so it would need to an optional feature, ie. create a css with the conversion and a css without. A demo of what I mean in the following video -&gt; http://madskristensen.net/post/Embed-images-in-stylesheets.aspx</p>\r\n<p>Any thoughts on this? Just another area in which this add in could help improve the performance of css.</p>",
