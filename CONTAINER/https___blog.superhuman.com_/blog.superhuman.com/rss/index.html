Things roll so fast that my priorities are always changing — but with Remind Me, I can bring an email back the next day, or whenever I'm ready to act on it. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/09/combined_remind-me_desktop.gif" class="kg-image" alt="The mission-driven investor regaining time and energy with Superhuman"></figure><p>For my Devland business, everything changed.

The mobile app almost feels like texting. And I love Superhuman's dark mode as well — it calms my nerves.</p><p>My wife used to be the one reminding me to respond to my personal email. But now, I'm the one responding and reminding her! I cleared out 53,000 messages, and when I got to Inbox Zero and saw the beautiful image, I sat there thinking: "I don't feel bad anymore." </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/09/Devon_Header-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The mission-driven investor regaining time and energy with Superhuman" srcset="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Devon_Header-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/Devon_Header-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/Devon_Header-1.jpg 1600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/09/Devon_Header-1.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="regaining-control-of-my-day-with-superhuman">Regaining control of my day with Superhuman</h2><p>We create best when we're in our best energy state. </p><p>But when email gets pushed — because you've run out of time and energy in your day — you go to bed with negative feelings.

And during my onboarding, I found that Superhuman's UI is designed to make emptying your inbox fun!</p><h2 id="how-superhuman-declutters-your-brain">How Superhuman declutters your brain</h2><p>A disorganized inbox is like a cluttered brain. In a single day, you might have 15,000 different thoughts. But around 13,000 of them are subconscious; you might not know what triggered an emotional response in you, until you analyze and break it down. </p><p>That's exactly like a disorganized inbox. Your email can be really triggering, because it constantly reminds you of your insecurities. Your inbox tells you all the things you have to do. Everything is coming at you in 13,000 different directions — and if there's no organizational process, you feel overwhelmed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/09/split-inbox.gif" class="kg-image" alt="The medical consultant who keeps his business running with Superhuman"></figure><p>But with Superhuman, you can control the flow of information by splitting your inbox into different workstreams, and tackling them by priority. You can say: "I'm going to take care of these important messages right now, and then I'm going to work out or do yoga. And only then will I take care of the less important tasks."</p><p>And if your brain doesn't want to take care of something right away, you can use "Remind Me" to quickly snooze it for as many days as you like — it will disappear from your inbox, and come back when you're ready.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/09/003-e19d63a257e76cd8809e8320f45dbc5f27dd68b6.gif" class="kg-image" alt="The medical consultant who keeps his business running with Superhuman"></figure><h2 id="leveling-up-as-a-consultant-and-leader">Leveling up as a consultant and leader</h2><p>Superhuman has accelerated my ability to lead.</p><p>As part of my consulting work, I educate other physicians on team culture and collaboration. One of the things I always say is: you have to make sure your team does <em>1 thing well</em>, instead of 18 million things poorly. </p><p>To achieve that, clear handoffs are truly important. They prevent your team from feeling blocked or getting distracted with non-urgent tasks. But sometimes within a team, you have multiple people with the same responsibility — clear handoffs don't always happen. </p><p>If I can empty my inbox, I know that my handoffs are complete. </p><p>My team is not waiting all day for me to do something. I know what's being done, what's being missed, and if there are redundancies. </p><p>When I clear my inbox, I'm in control and able to practice at the top of my game.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><a href="https://superhuman.com?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=2021-09-13_casestudy_medical" class="cta">Get started with Superhuman</a><!--kg-card-end: html-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The eco-friendly entrepreneur saving hours with Superhuman]]></title><description><![CDATA[Less email, more family time: here's how the CEO of custom T-shirt business Real Thread saves hours with Superhuman.]]></description><link>https://blog.superhuman.com/the-eco-friendly-entrepreneur-saving-hours-with-superhuman/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">612d05eae841d3003b4cdec6</guid><category><![CDATA[Productivity]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dru Dalton]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 21:45:16 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/08/Dru-Dalton-Header.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/08/Dru-Dalton-Header.jpg" alt="The eco-friendly entrepreneur saving hours with Superhuman"><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drudalton/"><em>Dru Dalton</em></a><em> is CEO at </em><a href="https://www.realthread.com/"><em>Real Thread</em></a><em>, a custom T-shirt business he started in college.

I learned about how water-based ink soaks into the fibers of a shirt rather than sitting on top of the shirt — resulting in a super soft print that can't crack and peel like traditional screen-printing does. </p><p>This printing method not only benefits the shirts' quality and wearer's comfort, but it's eco-friendly as well — I became obsessed. </p><blockquote>"With <a href="https://superhuman.com?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_campaign=2021-08-30_casestudy_eco">Superhuman</a>, I get time back for people."</blockquote><h2 id="unlocking-faster-email-with-superhuman">Unlocking faster email with Superhuman</h2><p>The best things that land in my inbox are travel opportunities to meet customers, vendors, and friends.

Reorganizing your Trello seems strangely appealing. There's even a siren song emanating from your laundry basket, enticing you to humdrum household chores…   </p><p>Left untamed, procrastination is destructive. Indeed, <a href="https://file.scirp.org/pdf/PSYCH_2014091715410990.pdf">regular procrastination impairs your career growth and impacts your mental health.</a></p><p>Yet many of the world's most creative people procrastinate (case in point: <a href="https://jamesclear.com/akrasia">Victor Hugo</a>). <a href="https://file.scirp.org/pdf/PSYCH_2014091715410990.pdf">Procrastination is associated with impulsiveness</a>, and <a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/creativity-impulsiveness-14068/">impulsiveness is directly linked to creativity</a>! </p><p>By harnessing procrastination, you can become even more productive. Here's how… </p><h2 id="the-war-inside-your-brain">The war inside your brain</h2><p>Knowing you should do one thing, while being helplessly drawn to another, is an age-old malaise. Ancient Greek philosophers described it as <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/CABN.8.4.402"><em>akrasia</em>, acting against your better judgment</a>.</p><p>Nowadays, we understand procrastination as a battle between your prefrontal cortex and your limbic system:</p><ul><li><strong>Your prefrontal cortex.</strong> This governs executive function: your goals, values, and ability to make complex strategic choices. <br><br>Example: Quarterly planning demands tough conversations and uncomfortable trade-offs — but getting it right can change your trajectory. Your prefrontal cortex helps you prioritize quarterly planning, weighing its temporary discomfort against the long-term benefits.<br><br></li><li><strong>Your limbic system.</strong> This is your primordial pleasure center, or "lizard brain": it's short-termist, and always prioritizes your physical and mental comfort. <br><br>Example: You try to focus on quarterly planning, but your eyes glaze over. Your limbic system is kicking in, you're itching for a gratifying rush of dopamine… hmm, maybe I'll make some edits to my next blog post! 🙃 <br></li></ul><p>Of course, the pleasures of procrastination are short-lived and unsatisfying. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU">Tim Urban describes this as the "dark playground"</a> — when the relief is tarnished by guilt.</p><p>When procrastination beckons, how do you respond? First, identify whether this is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15959999/#:~:text=Passive%20procrastinators%20are%20procrastinators%20in,make%20deliberate%20decisions%20to%20procrastinate.">passive or active procrastination — they have radically different outcomes.</a> </p><h2 id="the-2-types-of-procrastination">The 2 types of procrastination</h2><ul><li><strong>Passive procrastination.</strong> If your primary impulse is to <em>withdraw from the task</em>, you are passively procrastinating. <br><br>Diagnosis: You feel hesitant and indecisive, bargaining with yourself about when and how to complete the task. Cue anxiety, scrolling through Twitter, and potentially missing your deadline.<br><br></li><li><strong>Active procrastination. </strong>If your primary impulse is to <em>redirect your energy elsewhere</em>, you are actively procrastinating.<br><br>Diagnosis: You feel energized and purposeful, but can't bring yourself to complete the task. So you leap into another project with gusto — you'll get back to the original task later, right?<br></li></ul><p>You might actively procrastinate over one task, and passively procrastinate over another. How can you optimize your productivity in each case? </p><h2 id="passive-procrastination">Passive procrastination<br></h2><p>The brain's reward-based learning system has 3 components: <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/12/how-to-break-up-with-your-bad-habits">trigger, behaviour, and reward</a>:</p><ol><li>When you passively procrastinate, the <strong>trigger</strong> is your feeling of discomfort — perhaps your anticipation of the difficulty or tedium of completing a task.<br><br></li><li>Your limbic system steers you to a <strong>behavior</strong> that's easy and comforting — like browsing YouTube, or making another coffee. <br><br></li><li>Your <strong>reward</strong> is a fleeting dopamine rush — until you remember your task's fast-approaching deadline. <br></li></ol><p>When we yield to our limbic system's pursuit of pleasure, we reinforce this loop. That means we're more likely to procrastinate in the future.</p><p><strong>The technique: Summon mindful curiosity to reframe your reward.</strong></p><p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41042-019-00025-4">Mindfulness reduces procrastination.</a> So acknowledge the trigger, consider your craving, then reframe the reward. </p><p>Visualize the reward of procrastinating: momentary amusement or distraction, followed by guilt. Then visualize the reward of completing the task: satisfaction, and a feeling of progress. </p><p>With practice, procrastination's guilty pleasures will shine less brightly. You can then focus on the greater reward: completing the challenging task!</p><h2 id="active-procrastination">Active procrastination</h2><p>What about active procrastination, where you feel energized but your brain simply won't focus on your intended task? </p><p>Perhaps you need additional time to ruminate, or you're delaying because you work more effectively under pressure. This is <a href="https://dev.to/remojansen/strategic-procrastination-and-software-design-559m#:~:text=Strategic%20procrastination%20is%20deliberately%20not,new%20ground%20for%20massive%20action.">strategic procrastination</a>, and it's easy to optimize.</p><p><strong>The technique: Allow yourself a period of time-boxed procrastination. </strong></p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/opinion/sunday/why-i-taught-myself-to-procrastinate.html?_r=1">Procrastinating before a task encourages divergent thinking</a>, which leads to your most creative ideas. So when your mind bolts from a task, let it break free! Take a walk outside, indulge in social media, or peruse a favorite publication — just set a time you'll return to your task, and stick to it. </p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://blog.superhuman.com/the-benefits-of-european-style-vacation/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=2021-08-10_procrastination">unplugged vacations inspire creativity</a> — time them strategically, before your biggest decisions.

With the exception of sleep, we spend more time on email than anything else we do.</p><p>When I first had the idea for Superhuman, I realized that if we could free people up from spending so much time on email, we could help them be happier and more productive. We could give them more time to truly focus, and to achieve their full potential.</p><p>Since then, Superhuman customers have sent over 100 million messages, triaged over 335 million conversations, and used over 1 billion keyboard shortcuts. Together, they have saved<strong> </strong>tens of millions of hours.</p><p>As the world shifted to remote work over the last 18 months, our mission became even more urgent. We found that two-thirds of remote workers would resume their commute if it meant unburdening themselves from email. In fact, we found that <a href="https://blog.superhuman.com/the-state-of-your-inbox-in-2021/">nearly a quarter of remote workers find email so unpleasant that it makes them want to leave their jobs</a>.</p><p>Today, we are more committed than ever to building the fastest email experience ever made — to alleviate this burden, and to help people be brilliant at what they do.</p><p>For that reason, I am<strong> </strong>thrilled to share that Superhuman has raised $75M in new financing!</p><p>The round was led by IVP, with participation from Tiger Global and strategic investors including Drew Houston (CEO of Dropbox), Timothy Young (President of Dropbox), Jason Citron (CEO of Discord), Henrique Dubugras (co-CEO of Brex), Arianna Huffington (CEO of Thrive), Ashton Kutcher, Will Smith, and the Chainsmokers.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajayvashee">Ajay Vashee</a>, General Partner at IVP, is joining our Board of Directors. Ajay joined Dropbox as Head of Finance, became Head of Corporate Development, and then became the CFO that took Dropbox public. Very few people have grown with a company from the first hundred employees to become a C-suite leader, and even fewer have done so at a company as relevant to Superhuman as Dropbox. Ajay brings a wealth of invaluable experience, and we could not be more excited for him to join the team.</p><p>This new funding will enable us to bring Superhuman to everybody, starting with the hundreds of millions of people who use Outlook and Android.</p><p>We are also making Superhuman significantly more powerful and even faster than before. No matter how much we build, we believe that our work is never done: we can always make it better. We recently doubled down on calendaring — <a href="https://twitter.com/superhuman/status/1296495478201298947">making it blazingly fast and surprisingly fun to create events</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Superhuman/status/1389990046497873921">making it instantaneous to include Zoom and Google Meet links</a>. We will add even more calendar functionality in the near future, allowing you to automatically insert availability and send fewer messages about scheduling — which turn out to be a third of our email!</p><p>We will invest in writing assistance, to correct errors as you type and help you type even faster, and in task management, so you can assign or delegate email. We plan to build new integrations with best-in-class tools like Grammarly, Hubspot, and Salesforce — all of which will make Superhuman even more effective.</p><p>Finally, this funding will help us achieve some of our biggest and most ambitious goals, such as bringing Superhuman to the enterprise, and eventually to modes of communication beyond email itself.</p><p>In the near term, we are ramping up hiring across every team. If our mission excites you, <a href="https://superhuman.com/jobs">we'd love to talk</a>!</p><p>And to all who have been part of the journey thus far, a huge and heartfelt thank you!

This is the narrative arc framing ancient myths, the <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy, and some of the best pitches I've heard. Use 3 key ingredients:</p><h3 id="1-call-to-adventure">1. Call to adventure</h3><p>Even if your story is short on elves, barbarians, and clashes of sword, you can still compose a gripping tale. Your story needs a hero — your customer! Appeal to resonant truths: deeply held beliefs about the human condition, like our drive for success, and persistence through adversity.  </p><p>Example: <em>The hero is stressed, behind on their email, and struggling to be a great colleague, partner, or parent. But our hero believes that success comes to those who strive for it. The hero hears a call to adventure: Superhuman! Perhaps they could do their email twice as fast…</em></p><h3 id="2-victory-over-crisis">2. Victory over crisis</h3><p>The hero struggles to overcome adversity; their foes might be pain points, or even your competitors. Fortunately, a wise sage guides the hero's path. In <em>Star Wars</em>, this is Yoda. For your startup, it is your team or product! </p><p>Example: <em>First, our hero hesitates. They're busy, stuck in old habits, and Superhuman is a great unknown. But finally, they heed the call to adventure — and are trained by the wise sage — aka </em><a href="https://blog.superhuman.com/the-fastest-way-to-inbox-zero-a-single-coaching-session/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=202107-15_storytelling"><em>Superhuman's onboarding specialists</em></a><em>. Armed with formidable new email powers, they face their greatest challenge: the myriad fears that fester at the bottom of their inbox. The hero survives and triumphs! </em></p><h3 id="3-transformation">3. Transformation</h3><p>Your story doesn't end with your hero surmounting a challenge; they must be transformed for the long-term. Look to the enduring benefits your product creates — and the emotions they inspire. </p><p>Example: <em>Our hero achieves Inbox Zero and their workflow is forever transformed. They are free to be their best self, as a colleague, partner, or parent — and inspire others to do the same! </em></p><p>Remember: storytelling isn't spin, it's strategy. So if your story doesn't flow, something is missing — and you can use the Hero's Journey to figure out what.</p><h2 id="telling-your-story-the-power-of-neural-coupling">Telling your story: the power of neural coupling</h2><p>Your heroic storyline will command attention. But telling it in a fluent, personal way will elicit emotion. Your story will then have impact long after it has been told: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4445577/">emotionally engaging narratives inspire post-narrative action</a>. </p><p>Whether you orate over Zoom or converse over coffee, great narratives have incredible impact: <strong>neural coupling</strong>. <a href="https://www.arielgroup.com/why-storytelling-works-the-science/">Your listeners' neurons will fire in the same pattern as yours </a>— as if they are experiencing the story themselves! </p><p>Here's how to do this:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/public-speaking-tips/">Adopt a laughing mindset.</a> Set up callbacks, then reference them later in the story. This mimics the rhythm of a 2-way conversation, flooding your listeners' brains with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03701">oxytocin — the neurochemical elixir that builds trust</a>.    <br></li><li><a href="https://review.firstround.com/good-leaders-are-great-storytellers-our-6-tips-for-telling-stories-that-resonate">Use the Bar Test.</a> How would you tell your story to a stranger at a bar? Practice telling your story without visual aids, to someone who has no context. This forces you to be succinct — you'll focus on the most exciting elements, and this will make your story memorable.</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to create remarkable product GIFs]]></title><description><![CDATA[Want to bring your product to life?

Write your script</h2><p>First, you must create a delightful storyline.</p><p>Your feature is only as remarkable as the problem it solves or the benefit it provides.

Instead, we chose something relatable but fun: a surprise virtual birthday celebration…</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/07/GIF_01--1-.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to create remarkable product GIFs" srcset="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/07/GIF_01--1-.png 600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/07/GIF_01--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/07/GIF_01--1-.png 1600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/07/GIF_01--1-.png 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Refine your story until it is engaging and ultra concise. Your copy should resemble real-life interactions — so read copy aloud, to weed out unnatural phrases and awkward transitions. As you write and rewrite, search for every opportunity to condense your copy. This keeps your GIF short and your message clear.</p><h2 id="2-set-the-stage">2. Set the stage</h2><p>Next, set the stage to record your GIF. Just like on a movie set, the actors need to be fully prepared and every prop must be carefully positioned.</p><h3 id="assemble-your-cast">Assemble your cast</h3><p>To tell the perfect product story, create new accounts. Real data is messy and may reveal sensitive company info. Test accounts distract from the illusion of real-life use cases — it's hard to relate to a user called "Test-Mary-1"!</p><p>So craft the environment from scratch. At Superhuman, we built a few characters for our GIFs. They come complete with profile photos, thanks to stock images and <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com">AI wizardry</a>.</p><p>Meet our cast: Nicole, Allie, Noel, Amelia, Miles, and Jeanine!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/07/GIF_02--1-.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to create remarkable product GIFs" srcset="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/07/GIF_02--1-.png 600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/07/GIF_02--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/07/GIF_02--1-.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="do-a-dress-rehearsal">Do a dress rehearsal</h3><p>Make sure every step works exactly as intended, and that the flow reveals only what is absolutely necessary. This minimizes distractions and keeps viewers glued to the GIF.</p><h3 id="practice-your-lines">Practice your lines</h3><p>Thorough rehearsals reduce the likelihood of repeat recordings. They also minimize post-production efforts. You must be familiar with every interaction, so click through buttons and type out your lines — this ensures you will tap them typo-free during the recording.</p><h3 id="platform-check">Platform check</h3><p>Your product is center stage. Keep everything else minimal.</p><p>When preparing to record GIFs of your desktop application, use <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> to maintain consistency. With a few keystrokes, you can lock position and size: your app won't shift between recordings, and you won't have to align takes when combining raw footage.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/07/KeyboardMaestro.gif" class="kg-image" alt="How to create remarkable product GIFs"></figure><p>When preparing to record GIFs on mobile, turn off all extraneous keyboard features like predictive text and character preview. This ensures your GIF is clean and focused.</p><h2 id="3-lights-camera-action-">3. Lights, camera, action!</h2><p>Ready to hit record?</p><p>Use <a href="https://screenflow.en.softonic.com/mac">ScreenFlow</a> to record the GIF for both desktop and mobile apps. On desktop, you can record with multiple cameras, microphones, and screens. On iPhone, it overrides status bars — replacing them with consistent time and an always-full battery!</p><h2 id="4-make-the-final-cut">4. Make the final cut</h2><p>Now, the careful process of sculpting begins. We edit our GIFs in <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html">Adobe Premiere</a>: it's robust, reliable, and deservedly popular.</p><h3 id="only-keep-the-absolutely-necessary">Only keep the absolutely necessary</h3><p>Edit out unnecessary screens, cursors, transitions, appearances by other apps, and anything else that doesn’t add to the storyline.</p><p>Remember, every single frame adds to a GIF's file size. The editing stage is an opportunity to shave away precious kilobytes.</p><h3 id="speed-up-the-mundane">Speed up the mundane</h3><p>Allow space to reveal your colorful storyline, but don't let sluggish typing speeds and clunky transitions dullen the GIF's impact. Speed up typing, but retain a natural feel: make sure you can see individual letters as they're typed. The amount depends on your typing speed, but we speed up typing by as much as 600%!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/07/SpedUpTyping--1-.gif" class="kg-image" alt="How to create remarkable product GIFs"></figure><p>Keep the blinking cursor at standard speed, or will it look jarringly mechanical.</p><h3 id="focus-on-details">Focus on details</h3><p>Here's your chance to highlight what's special about your new feature. Rather than showing the entire UI, zoom or pan to focus on interactions. Viewers should not have to search the screen to find the action.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/07/Zoom--1-.gif" class="kg-image" alt="How to create remarkable product GIFs"></figure><h3 id="ensure-smooth-looping">Ensure smooth looping</h3><p>The transition from the end of the GIF back to the beginning should feel smooth. For example, we start and end each GIF by fading to and from a white background.</p><h2 id="5-screen-a-preview">5. Screen a preview</h2><p>Finished editing? You're ready to export and test the GIF for all its uses: social media, customer emails, job posts, and your company blog.</p><p>If your GIF is destined for emails, keep it under 4.5MB: this ensures swift loading while maintaining image quality.</p><p>Each GIF is unique! Optimizations depend on the GIF's content and length — you'll need to judge them by eye. We use Photoshop and GIF Brewery to experiment with compression algorithms, frame rate, and color.</p><h3 id="frame-rate">Frame rate</h3><p>The human eye cannot perceive the difference between 30FPS and 60FPS: although <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/how-many-frames-per-second-can-the-human-eye-really-see/">the maximum threshold is hotly debated</a>! For a product GIF, 15FPS is good, and aim for no less than 9FPS — otherwise your GIF will appear choppy and abrupt in transitions.</p><ul><li>If you shoot for a higher frame rate and try to reduce size with aggressive compression and fewer colors, your GIF will have visible and unsightly artifacts.<br><br></li><li>If you aim for a lower frame rate, you can use less compression and more colors. The GIF will be less smooth, but it's easier for our eyes to thread frames together than to ignore low quality or incorrect colors.</li></ul><p>We've found that increasing color count by 40–50 sometimes only increases GIF size by 0.2MB. But increasing frame rate by 1FPS can increase GIF size by more than 2MB!</p><h3 id="compression-algorithm">Compression algorithm</h3><p>You should choose a compression algorithm that matches your content. In Photoshop:</p><ul><li>"Selective" preserves the greatest color integrity. This is ideal for depicting the closest colors to those in your product interfaces.<br><br></li><li>"Diffusion" dithers gradients into a natural-seeming pattern. You can <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/animate/using/optimization-options-for-images-and-animated-gifs.html">adjust the dithering level to trade off size and quality</a>. This is ideal for photographs, like our Inbox Zero images.</li></ul><p>Example: since we usually feature Inbox Zero images, we use "ordered dithering" in GIF Brewery, and "diffusion" in Photoshop.</p><p>Turn on transparency when compressing GIFs. Even if your GIF doesn't have transparent pixels, this setting reuses any pixels with identical color information over frames, requiring less image data.</p><h3 id="color">Color</h3><p>All GIFs have at most 256 colors. When compressing with this limited color palette, a pure white value might be swapped for duller shades of cream.</p><p>Superhuman GIFs have white backgrounds, to blend seamlessly into our email communications — so we're vigilant about ensuring snowy whites stay pristine! If compressing in Photoshop, you can specifically include a pure white (<code>#FFFFFF</code>) in the color palette. </p><p>Sometimes, you may want to deliberately use fewer than 256 colors to save space, allowing for a longer GIF.</p><p>Once you have exported your GIF, test it in its destination platforms, whether email or social media. Counter-intuitively, some platforms like Twitter do better with GIFs than with video. This is because almost all platforms take the liberty of re-encoding video, whereas GIFs tend to remain untouched. Look out for jarring loops, off-colors and those pesky artifacts!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/07/zoom-google-meet-integration-1.gif" class="kg-image" alt="How to create remarkable product GIFs"></figure><p>Product GIFs breathe life into marketing campaigns while conveying complex features.

Your fingers dance across the keyboard. You're driven by boundless energy and a wellspring of creativity — you are completely absorbed by your task. </p><p>Flow turns work into play.  It can make you <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7551835/">5x more productive</a>. Some would even say that <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_flow_the_secret_to_happiness">flow is the deepest form of happiness</a>!</p><h2 id="the-incredible-power-of-flow">The incredible power of flow</h2><p>During flow, our brains enter an altered state: intense and focused concentration on the present, combined with a total sense of personal control. </p><p>The prefrontal cortex, which controls analysis and metacognition, downregulates when we're in flow. This is <a href="http://ardjoena.nl/Media/Neurocognitive%20mechanisms%20underlying%20the%20experience%20of%20flow.pdf">transient hypofrontality</a>, and <a href="https://time.com/56809/the-science-of-peak-human-performance/">it frees us from hesitation and inner criticism</a>.</p><p>When in flow, we don't care what others think. Flow feels so easy that we always know what to do next. And flow is so rewarding that we experience intrinsic motivation — <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-19102-7_6">the most powerful form of motivation</a>, where activities become inherently interesting and satisfying.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Conditions for Flow </strong><br><br>• Knowing what to do next<br>• Knowing how to do it<br>• Freedom from distractions<br>• Clear and immediate feedback<br>• High perceived challenge and high perceived skill<br><br>Csikszentmihalyi, M.; Abuhamdeh, S., &amp; Nakamura, J.; "Flow", in <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-08058-000">Handbook of Competence and Motivation</a>, eds Elliot, A.J., &amp; Dweck, C.S. (New York: Guildford Press, 2005), 598–698</em></blockquote><p>How do you design experiences that cultivate this elusive, euphoric state?</p><p>Here are 3 principles, with examples of how we use them at Superhuman.</p><h2 id="1-make-the-next-action-obvious">1. Make the next action obvious </h2><p>Hesitation is the flow killer.</p><p>When somebody uses your product, their next action should always be obvious — and it should be obvious how to do it. <a href="https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/collections/don-normans-principles-of-design">Make functions visible, and limit alternative actions.</a></p><p><strong>Example:</strong> When you archive an email in Superhuman, you immediately see the next one. There is minimal room for decision fatigue: you simply process one email at a time. This creates flow. When you archive an email in Gmail, you go back to the inbox. You now have to decide what to do next, and you have to do this every single time. This destroys flow.</p><h2 id="2-give-clear-and-immediate-feedback-with-no-distraction">2. Give clear and immediate feedback with no distraction</h2><p>When somebody takes an action, they should get feedback instantly.</p><p>Milliseconds matter. They may not seem important, but 100 ms is the threshold where actions feel instant. If your product is slower, it will invite distraction, and then… hmm, I wonder what's happening on Twitter!</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> When you take an action in Superhuman, the app responds in milliseconds. Initially, we aimed for 100 ms or less. We can now render an email in less than 32 ms. This removes opportunities for distraction, and creates flow.</p><p>Rapid response eliminates temporal distraction. But what about visual distraction? Dieter Rams said it best: <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design">"Good design is as little design as possible."</a></p><p>Look at every part of your product and ask: "If I had to remove just one thing, what would it be?" Remove it, and then do this again.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> In Superhuman, you can't see the inbox at the same time as a conversation. And so — very deliberately — you can't see what is next, or any new email. This creates flow. In Gmail, you see your inbox at the same time as new conversations. You are distractible by default, which destroys flow.</p><h2 id="3-balance-high-perceived-challenge-with-high-perceived-skill">3. Balance high perceived challenge with high perceived skill</h2><p>Now for the most delicate alchemy: users must perceive high challenge, and feel that they have the high skills to match. </p><p>We can visualize this with the Experience Fluctuation Model:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FcDoKpJ7XiP8NEv-kYdp1cuf_-kLL4-buU0f3pfOCfNPNTNWDPbRgZA0Xbi-gXsX2cxcebxzCFHwB2bfKX-Xb1Kzqwqd_HvLdhVYvKIMsVx8YDtxm_08zYeYi6Fb1jCDFo_TKdER" class="kg-image" alt="The 3 design principles for creating flow"></figure><p>When skill exceeds challenge, we feel relaxed or bored. When challenge exceeds skill, we feel anxious or worried. You can directly affect challenge and skill with your experience design.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> For most people, Gmail is the left slice. Some people feel bored or apathetic: their skill is low-medium, but their email doesn’t matter. Some feel worry: their skill is low-medium, but their email does matter. Many feel anxiety: their skill is low-medium, but their email is super important — and they are failing at it!</p><p>Through <a href="https://blog.superhuman.com/the-fastest-way-to-inbox-zero-a-single-coaching-session/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=xpost">1:1 onboarding</a>, we massively increase skill for almost everybody. But what if your email was not that hard, or you were already very skilled? If we did nothing else, you still would not achieve flow.</p><p>Well then — and this will sound crazy — we <em>increase</em> the challenge. We set a challenging goal: hit Inbox Zero without ever touching your mouse!  This balances challenge with skill, and once again creates flow.</p><p>This is the most counterintuitive aspect of flow. To create flow, you should sometimes make the goals of your product <em>harder</em> to achieve.</p><p>With these 3 principles, you can create flow for your users. Your users will feel intrinsically motivated, and your product will become inherently interesting and satisfying. <a href="https://blog.superhuman.com/game-design-not-gamification?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-24_flow">To learn more, see my 7 principles of game design</a>!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to lead retros without the blame game]]></title><description><![CDATA[You can learn as much from successes as failures.

Through thoughtful retros, <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/media-relations-and-communications/press-releases/is-learning-from-your-mistakes-a-myth">we can learn as much from success as we do from failure</a>.</p><p>Retros also create space for teams to feel heard and for leaders to demonstrate action. This is critical, as <a href="https://sri.cornell.edu/sri/polls/files/cnss/2009/reports/Report%202%20CNSS%202009%20-%20General%20%20Results.pdf">more than 40% of employees withhold ideas out of a sense of futility</a>.</p><p>Here's how we retro at Superhuman…</p><h2 id="1-engage-with-the-prime-directive">1. Engage with the Prime Directive </h2><p>Like many startups, our retros are guided by Norm Kerth's <a href="https://www.funretrospectives.com/prime-directive/">Prime Directive</a>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/06/Quote_01.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How to lead retros without the blame game" srcset="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Quote_01.jpg 600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/Quote_01.jpg 1000w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/Quote_01.jpg 1600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/06/Quote_01.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>But stating the Prime Directive isn't enough: you must communicate <em>why</em> it matters.</p><p>The Prime Directive acknowledges that processes are generally at fault, rather than people. Believing in everybody's sincere effort isn't just about good will — it creates the optimal conditions to stimulate learning. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103109002601">When we blame others, we learn less and perform worse.</a></p><h2 id="2-gather-input-synchronously-and-asynchronously">2. Gather input synchronously and asynchronously</h2><p>Retros generate a lot of information, but you need both synchronous and asynchronous communication to understand it fully.</p><p>Synchronous conversation will generate a holistic overview. It is also an excellent barometer for team morale.<br><br><strong>How to do this:</strong> Schedule a retro within 2 weeks of the project ending. <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/forgetting-curve.htm">Memories fade surprisingly fast</a>, so encourage folks to note down their thoughts — both during the project and immediately after.</p><p>Asynchronous conversation will generate candid insights and detailed data. It also <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334970867_The_New_Groupthink_and_Idea_Generation_-_An_investigation_of_hybrid_brainstorming_as_key_to_introverts'_enhanced_contribution_to_ideation">increases participation and prevents groupthink</a>. </p><p><strong>How to do this:</strong> Before the retro, invite input from across the business — the most productive retros air feedback from every team involved. Inside the retro, include 10–15 minutes for silent brainstorming.</p><h2 id="3-separate-brainstorming-from-analysis">3. Separate brainstorming from analysis</h2><p>Most retros ask 3 questions: What did we do well? What did we do less well? And what should we do differently next time?</p><p>These questions are good. However, we can do better with a little more structure.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/06/Quote_02-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How to lead retros without the blame game" srcset="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Quote_02-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/Quote_02-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/Quote_02-1.jpg 1600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/06/Quote_02-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>How to do this:</strong> Structure your agenda as follows…</p><ul><li><strong>Brainstorm: </strong>Recap the project's goals and outcomes, then ask the team to write down discussion topics — what went well, what didn't, what they'd do differently.

The tasks always just take longer!</p><h2 id="what-am-i-missing-in-my-inbox">What am I missing in my inbox?</h2><p>I also had all kinds of syncing issues between different email clients. I always had that slight worry: are there things I'm missing?</p><p>Sometimes the way emails threaded together didn't give me confidence that I was replying to the right person. It's harder to write really important emails in Gmail being super confident that it will land in the exact way that I want it to. I was diverting that kind of work to Outlook, using Gmail for other stuff, and switching between the 2 platforms… which was hard work.</p><blockquote>"I really think that Superhuman has helped with my personal resilience."</blockquote><p>Then I read about Superhuman on a productivity blog, and joined the wait list. Somebody from the company reached out, and I jumped at the chance of an onboarding call! </p><p>I started to use Superhuman at the same time as dealing with homeschooling my kids during the pandemic: the timing was perfect! I have <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a> running in the background on my system.

You have to do your email. You have to submit your expense reports. You have to enter data in your CRM. But what if we could make it less like work and more like play? With game design, we can.</p><h2 id="game-design-is-not-gamification">Game design is not gamification</h2><p>I will shortly share what game design is. But first, let me say what it isn't. </p><p><strong>Game design is not gamification.</strong> It is not simply taking your product and adding points, levels, trophies, and badges. Gamification was a big deal 10 years ago, but it didn’t work. And to understand why, we have to understand human motivation.</p><p>In the 1970s, Stanford researchers recruited 50 kids, ages 3 to 4. All of these children were previously interested in drawing. Some of the kids were told they would get a reward, a certificate with a gold seal and a ribbon. The other kids weren't told about a reward. They didn't even know one existed. The children were then invited into separate rooms to draw for 6 minutes, and they would either get a reward or not.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/06/Percentage-of-time-spent-drawing.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to build great products with game design, not gamification" srcset="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Percentage-of-time-spent-drawing.png 600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/Percentage-of-time-spent-drawing.png 1000w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/Percentage-of-time-spent-drawing.png 1600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/06/Percentage-of-time-spent-drawing.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Over the next few days, they were observed to see how much they would continue to draw by themselves. The children who didn't get a reward spent 17% of their time drawing. But the children who did get a reward only spent 8% of their time drawing. The reward had halved their motivation.</p><h2 id="the-power-of-intrinsic-motivation">The power of intrinsic motivation</h2><p>So, what’s going on here? Well, researchers distinguished intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. </p><ul><li>With intrinsic motivation, we do things because we find them inherently satisfying and interesting. </li><li>With extrinsic motivation, we do things to achieve rewards. </li></ul><p>And that's the problem with rewards – they massively undermine intrinsic motivation. </p><p><strong>This is also why gamification does not work. </strong>When gamification appears to work, it is because the underlying experience is already a game.</p><p>That brings us to the question, how do you design a game? </p><p>This is a question that I have been obsessed with for a long time. As a kid, I learned how to code just so I could make my own games. Before I was a founder, I worked as a game designer. And now as a founder, I’ve gone deep into the theory of game design. </p><h2 id="5-factors-of-game-design">5 factors of game design</h2><p>As it turns out, there is no unifying theory of game design. To create games, we have to draw upon the art and science of psychology, mathematics, interaction design, and storytelling. </p><p>These are 5 factors to consider. For each of these factors, I’m going to share how we use it at Superhuman and how you can use it in your own products.</p><blockquote>How do you design a game?<br>1. Goals<br>2. Emotions<br>3. Controls<br>4. Toys<br>5. Flow</blockquote><p>Games need goals. In fact, goals are a defining feature of games, but we can't just have any goals. <strong>We need good goals that are concrete, achievable, and rewarding.</strong></p><h2 id="designing-goals-in-software">Designing goals in software</h2><p>At Superhuman, we set a very concrete goal: get to Inbox Zero. But the goal must also be achievable, which is why we onboard our users. </p><p>For each new user, we do a live concierge onboarding. This is a 1:1 30-minute video call with one of our wonderful onboarding specialists. We teach faster workflows to get to Inbox Zero. We show powerful shortcuts so you never have to touch the mouse. And if you're far away from Inbox Zero, we'll wipe the slate clean so that you're close, thus making the goal more achievable.</p><p>But the goal must also be rewarding. When you hit Inbox Zero, you feel triumph over your email, a previously rare and incredibly rewarding experience.</p><p>Most business goals aren't clear. Business software does not have clear goals. And if they are clear, they are usually unrewarding and unachievable. This brings us to the first principle of game design. </p><h2 id="1-create-goals-that-are-concrete-achievable-and-rewarding">1. Create goals that are concrete, achievable, and rewarding</h2><p>Now, the best games create strong emotions because emotions are the foundation of our memory. We must, therefore, be able to analyze emotion. To do that, we need vocabulary.</p><p>There are many models of human emotion. The most famous is Plutchik's wheel. Plutchik identified 8 core emotions, with opposite emotions across from each other. For example, joy is opposite from grief. </p><p>You can blend adjacent emotions to create new complex feelings. For example, when you combine joy and anticipation, you get optimism. When you combine joy and trust, you get love.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/06/Plutchik-s-Model.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to build great products with game design, not gamification" srcset="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Plutchik-s-Model.png 600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/Plutchik-s-Model.png 1000w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/Plutchik-s-Model.png 1600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/06/Plutchik-s-Model.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>But as game designers, we need a much richer vocabulary than academia provides. The emotions we are aiming for are much more nuanced. This is the most useful model I have found by the Junto Institute, and it contains the subtleties that we need to care about.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/06/The-Emotional-Wheel.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to build great products with game design, not gamification" srcset="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/The-Emotional-Wheel.png 600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/The-Emotional-Wheel.png 1000w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/The-Emotional-Wheel.png 1600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/06/The-Emotional-Wheel.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>At Superhuman, we care deeply about joy. </strong></p><p>We design for enthusiasm and excitement. Our users come to us super excited to use the products. We design for hopefulness and optimism. Our users really want Superhuman to improve their lives. We design for pride and triumph, for when you hit Inbox Zero, especially if it's the first time in years, you rightly feel like you accomplished something special.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/06/Inbox-Zero.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to build great products with game design, not gamification" srcset="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Inbox-Zero.png 600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/Inbox-Zero.png 1000w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/Inbox-Zero.png 1600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/06/Inbox-Zero.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>When you do hit Inbox Zero, we show you stunning and gorgeous imagery. We do this to widen our emotional repertoire beyond joy into love and surprise. We show images that are serene and peaceful, images that create a sense of longing and sentimentality, images that even amaze and inspire a sense of awe.</p><p>You can also use the wheel to find emotions to remove. Many people come to us with negative feelings about their own email. They may feel helpless, anxious, annoyed, guilty, even powerless. This brings us to our second principle of game design: design for nuanced emotion.</p><h2 id="2-design-for-nuanced-emotion">2. Design for nuanced emotion</h2><p>Controls can be one of the main reasons why a game succeeds. Consider the Wiimote. The original Wii sold over 100 million units, and every controller since incorporated motion. But games require much more robust controls than we typically build for business software. </p><p>Imagine you’re playing a game like <em>Street Fighter</em>. It would be incredibly frustrating if the game ignored half your inputs, and your character flopped around, and then you died. But that is the status quo for business software today.</p><p>Let's say I want to email my co-founder, Conrad. In Gmail, the shortcut to compose an email is C. So I hit C, and then I type Conrad. </p><p>In Gmail, if I do this too fast, I end up with 2 drafts, and I'm sending an email to Rad. In Superhuman, we pipeline our keystrokes so this can never happen. In case you think I’m picking on Gmail, this kind of error is status quo for business software today.</p><p>This brings us to our 3rd principle of game design...</p><h2 id="3-create-rapid-and-robust-controls">3. Create rapid and robust controls</h2><p>Are toys the same as games? We play with toys, but we play games. A ball is a toy, but baseball is a game. As it turns out, the best games are made with toys. And then they are fun on multiple levels, the level of the toy and of the game itself.</p><p>In Superhuman, a favorite toy is the time autocompleter. You use this to snooze your emails. You can type in whatever you want. It may be gibberish, and it will do its best to understand you. For example, 3D becomes three days; 3H, three hours; 1MO, 1 month.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/06/Snooze.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to build great products with game design, not gamification" srcset="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Snooze.png 600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/Snooze.png 1000w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/Snooze.png 1600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/06/Snooze.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The time autocompleter is fun because it indulges playful exploration. What does it do? How does it work? When does it break? </p><p>It's not long in onboardings before people start trying to do things like this. Well, I wonder what happens if I keep on typing 10? Well, it turns out that's October the 10th at 10 PM. Or what happens if I put the PM in the middle? Well, it seems like that still works. What happens if I type out a sequence of 2s? Well, that's February the 2nd, 2020 at 2 PM.</p><p>And then you might start to try more complex inputs. How about in a fortnight and a day? It's not long before you find pleasant surprises. For example, you never have to do time zone math again – 8 AM in Tokyo, no problem. That's 8 PM, Eastern. </p><p>Many of our users are delighted to find that if they really want, they can snooze an email until never.</p><h2 id="4-make-fun-toys-and-combine-them-into-games">4. Make fun toys and combine them into games</h2><p>Consider your own product. Is it fun, even without a goal? Does it indulge moments of playful exploration? Does it create moments of pleasant surprise? If so, congratulations because then you have a toy and you're on the way to building a great game.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/06/What-is-flow-.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to build great products with game design, not gamification" srcset="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/What-is-flow-.png 600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/What-is-flow-.png 1000w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/What-is-flow-.png 1600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/06/What-is-flow-.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now, the previous 4 factors are critical to game design. Flow is perhaps the least understood. Flow is the intense and focused concentration on the present. Flow is so absorbing that we don't worry about the past or think about the future. Flow is so demanding that we don't care about what others think about us. Flow is so easy that we always know what to do next. Flow is so powerful that we lose track of time. It can either flash by in an instant or stretch out for infinity. And flow is so rewarding that our activities become intrinsically motivating, which as we know from earlier, is the most powerful and effective form of motivation.</p><p>In other words, flow is incredible. How do we make it? Well, these are the conditions:</p><blockquote>1. You must always know what to do next.<br>2. You must always know how to do it.<br>3. You must be free from distractions.<br>4. You must get clear and immediate feedback.<br>5. And this is the hardest to get right. You must feel a balance between challenge and skill.</blockquote><p>We can visualize the relationship between challenge and skill with the experience fluctuation model. If the activity is too hard, you'll feel anxious. If the activity is too easy, you'll feel relaxed or bored. To truly feel in flow, you need to perceive a high challenge and match it with high skill.</p><p>So, how do we create flow in Superhuman? Well, let's take these conditions one by one.</p><p>The first condition is knowing what to do next. You can make product decisions that make this dramatically easier for your users. In Gmail, when I archive this email, I end up back on the inbox. I now have to decide what to do next, and I have to do this every single time. This destroys flow. In Superhuman, when I archive the same email, I immediately see the next one. I don't have to make any decisions at all. This creates flow.</p><h2 id="5-make-the-next-action-obvious">5. Make the next action obvious</h2><p>The second condition of flow is knowing how to do it. Early on, we saw that users would forget our shortcuts. They knew what they wanted to do, but they didn't know how to do it. </p><p>So we built Superhuman Command. Simply hit Cmd+K, enter what you want to do, and not only will it do it for you, it will teach you the shortcut for next time.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/06/cmd-k.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to build great products with game design, not gamification" srcset="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/cmd-k.png 600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/06/cmd-k.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="6-give-clear-and-immediate-feedback-with-no-distractions">6. Give clear and immediate feedback with no distractions</h2><p>Next up: freedom from distractions. </p><p>In Superhuman, you can only see one conversation at a time, and you cannot see the inbox at the same time as the conversation. And so, quite deliberately, you can't see what's coming next or any new email. You can design your interfaces like this to reduce distraction and so create flow.</p><p>And the thing I'm most excited to share is this balance between challenge and skill. </p><h2 id="7-balance-high-perceived-skill-with-high-perceived-challenge">7. Balance high perceived skill with high perceived challenge</h2><p>This is the Experience Fluctuation Model. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/06/Flow.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How to build great products with game design, not gamification" srcset="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Flow.jpg 600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/Flow.jpg 1000w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/Flow.jpg 1600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/06/Flow.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>For most people, Gmail is the left-hand slice. Some people feel apathetic or worried. Their skill level is low-to-medium, but their email doesn't matter that much. Some people feel further up the left-hand side. Their skill level is low-to-medium, but their email does matter. Many people feel anxious. The skill level is low-to-medium, but their email really does matter, and they are failing at it. This is actually how most users come to us.</p><p>At Superhuman, we massively increase the skill level for almost everybody. But what happens if your email wasn't that challenging to begin with or you are already highly skilled? </p><p>Well, then, and this is going to sound crazy, we increase the challenge level. We give you a really challenging goal: <strong>hit Inbox Zero without ever touching the mouse</strong>. This balances your perceived skill with the perceived challenge, thus resulting in flow.</p><p>Flow is so important that it actually gives us 3 principles: make the next action obvious, give clear feedback immediately and with no distraction, and balance high perceived skill with high perceived challenge. This may counterintuitively mean making your products harder to use.</p><p>These are our 7 principles of game design. If you follow these, your users will be intrinsically motivated. They will use your products, not because they have to, but because they find it inherently interesting and satisfying. With these 7 principles, you can create products that are delightful, amazing, magical, and which fundamentally are games.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/06/Principles-of-Game-Design.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to build great products with game design, not gamification" srcset="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Principles-of-Game-Design.png 600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/Principles-of-Game-Design.png 1000w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/Principles-of-Game-Design.png 1600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/06/Principles-of-Game-Design.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
